# Working with arrays and collections  

Data structures are one of the essential aspects of every piece of software that has ever been written. Any
application, from simple command line util to scalable enterprise systems, constantly process various
information, that very often require specific grouping and access strategies. This aspect is addressed by
arrays and more advanced collection types available both in Java and .NET environments. By using the
Javonet framework, users gain ability to easily and effectively work with data structures originating
from the other platform.  
  
## Working with Arrays

During the array part of this tutorial, I'll be working with the following pseudo-service class, which main
purpose is to produce and consume various array-typed objects.

## Summary  
  
In this article we've focused on working with arrays and collections using Javonet
framework. As for array objects, differences of handling arrays of value- and reference-type objects have
been discussed, as well as framework's current limitations have been presented. We've briefly explained
basic techniques of handling collection objects, covering retrieval, enumeration- and index-based
access to their contents, as well as instantiation and usage as arguments in the method calls.
