# Working with collections  

Data structures are one of the essential aspects of every piece of software that has ever been written. Any
application, from simple command line util to scalable enterprise systems, constantly process various
information, that very often require specific grouping and access strategies. This aspect is addressed by
arrays and more advanced collection types available both in Java and .NET environments. By using the
Javonet framework, users gain ability to easily and effectively work with data structures originating

We've briefly explained basic techniques of handling collection objects, covering retrieval, enumeration- and index-based access to their contents, as well as instantiation and usage as arguments in the method calls.
