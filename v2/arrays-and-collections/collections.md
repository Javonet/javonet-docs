# Working with collections

Data structures are one of the essential aspects of every piece of software that has ever been written. Any application, from simple command line util to scalable enterprise systems, constantly process various information, that very often require specific grouping and access strategies. This aspect is addressed by arrays and more advanced collection types available in any modern technology. By using the Javonet framework, users gain ability to easily and effectively work with data structures originating from `{called_name}`.
  
This article provides an introduction to cross-technology handling of collections from `{called_name}` using `{calling_name}`.

With Javonet you can interact with lists, dictionaries etc. from `{called_name}` like they were available in `{calling_name}` but invocation must be performed through Javonet SDK API. 

## Working with list

:calling_id: StandardLibrary_HandleList
:called_source: v2/snippets/`{called_technology}`/TestClass.`{called_ext}`
:called_id: Empty

## Working with dictionary
