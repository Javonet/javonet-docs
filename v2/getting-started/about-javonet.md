# About Javonet  
      
Javonet enables software developers to instantly integrate several programming languages. Javonet is available for Windows, Linux and Mac operating systems as a downloadable package for supported programming languages. This article describes how to install prerequisites and lists getting started sections for supported technologies.
  
## Prerequisites  
  
Javonet is an advanced library enabling direct method calls between programming languages and modules. To use the guides both interacting technologies needs to be selected from left-side dropdown lists. Developer's technology is named "I code in" and technology to be called is named "I want to use". 
  
To call library/package/module from another technology, corresponding runtime has to be installed:  
  
## .NET Framework DLL library
[.Net Framework 4.7.2 Runtime](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet-framework/net472) or higher  

## .NET Core DLL library
[.Net Core 6.0 x64 Runtime](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/6.0) or higher  
 
## JAR library: JRE 1.8 or JDK 1.8. 
For example: [OpenJDK](https://www.openlogic.com/openjdk-downloads?field_java_parent_version_target_id=416&field_operating_system_target_id=All&field_architecture_target_id=391&field_java_package_target_id=All) or [Oracle](https://www.oracle.com/pl/java/technologies/javase/javase8u211-later-archive-downloads.html)

## Python package
[Python 3.11](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3113/). On Linux - if some packages are missing - it may be necessary to install libpython3.11-dev package too.

## Ruby package
[Ruby 2.7](https://rubyinstaller.org/downloads/) 

## Perl package
On Windows [Strawberry Perl 5.32](https://strawberryperl.com/download/5.32.1.1/strawberry-perl-5.32.1.1-64bit.msi). On Linux and MacOS use Perl 5.30 or higher

## Node.js package: 
[Node.js 18.16](https://nodejs.org/dist/latest-v18.x/) or higher
  

## Getting started  
  
Javonet is available as a package which can be downloaded from public repository appropriate for developer's language or from [My Javonet Portal](https://my.javonet.com). Detailed instructions are presented in the following sections:
