# In memory channel

Javonet offers two ways of communicating with called runtime. In memory channel is used to use Javonet within the same machine.  
  
Communication channel can be configured also with configuration file. Read more in [Configure Channel](guides/v2/`{calling_technology}`/`{called_technology}`/foundations/configure-channel.md).  
  
After selecting channel user selects a runtime to interact with in order to create [Runtime Context](https://www.javonet.com/guides/v2/`{calling_technology}`/`{called_technology}`/foundations/runtime-context.md) .
